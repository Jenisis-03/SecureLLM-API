# Python API for Secure LLM Integration

## Overview
This repository provides a production-ready implementation of a secure Python API for controlling access to Large Language Models (LLMs). Built with FastAPI, this solution demonstrates industry best practices for securely exposing AI capabilities to front-end applications without exposing sensitive API keys or allowing unrestricted resource usage.

## Key Features
- **Secure API Key Authentication**: Implementation of a custom API key system to control who can access your LLM endpoints
- **Credit-based Usage Limiting**: Built-in system to track and limit the number of requests per API key
- **Local LLM Integration**: Ready-to-use integration with Ollama for running open-source models locally
- **Cloud Provider Compatibility**: Easily adaptable for OpenAI, DeepSeek, or other cloud LLM providers
- **Production Security Patterns**: Demonstrates proper separation of front-end and back-end concerns for AI applications

## Why This Matters
In production environments, exposing LLM provider API keys directly in front-end code creates significant security and financial risks. This repository demonstrates the industry-standard pattern of creating an intermediary API that:
1. Protects your provider credentials
2. Controls which users can access the AI functionality
3. Limits usage to prevent unexpected costs
4. Provides a consistent interface regardless of the underlying LLM

## Technical Implementation
- **FastAPI**: High-performance, easy-to-use framework for creating Python APIs
- **Dependency Injection**: Elegant request validation and authorization pattern
- **Environment Variable Management**: Secure storage of sensitive configuration
- **HTTP Headers Authentication**: Standard API key implementation via X-API-Key header
- **Request Rate & Volume Control**: Custom credit-based limiting system

## Real-World Applications
This pattern is used in virtually all commercial AI applications, including:
- AI assistants with usage tiers
- Enterprise AI tools with department-specific access
- SaaS platforms with AI features as premium offerings
- Developer tools that expose LLM capabilities through APIs

## Getting Started
Check the documentation for setup instructions including:
1. Installing dependencies
2. Setting up Ollama or configuring cloud provider access
3. Configuring API keys and usage limits
4. Deploying the API to production environments
